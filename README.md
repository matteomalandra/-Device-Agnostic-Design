# Quiz generator
### Short description
The application is based on three screens. 
On the first screen (Home page) the user is shown a list of topics. By clicking on a topic, the user is directed to a new screen (Question page), where a question concerning the previously selected topic and a series of answers are shown. The user can choose one of the predefined answers. After choosing, the user is redirected to a new page (Result page), where the user can view the correctness of the question, how many questions in total were answered and how many questions were answered correctly.
Navigation between pages is made easy thanks to the existence of buttons that allow the user to move freely within the application.
On the question page and result page, there is always a button (arrow) within the top bar that allows the user to return to the home page at any time.
On the question page there is also a button at the bottom of the page (back to topics) that allows the user to return to the main page.
In the result page there are also two buttons at the bottom of the page, the first (back to topics) allows the user to return to the main page, the second (show new question) allows the user to return to the previous page, allowing him/her to answer another question on the same topic selected previously.
Depending on the screen size, the application returns a different interface to the user.
